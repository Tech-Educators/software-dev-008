      Dear Diary,
      
      I plunged into a Tekken marathon this weekend and let's just say my thumbs now have more combat experience than the entire Mishima family. I've battled more ninjas and jaguar-headed wrestlers than I can count, and I'm pretty sure I've developed a complex relationship with the 'retry' button. My virtual fighting career was a series of dramatic highs (those epic slow-mo wins) and soul-crushing lows (getting kicked in the face...repeatedly). If only my real-life reflexes were as quick as my character's, maybe I'd have dodged the pizza I dropped on my lap during a crucial match. Who knew the true Tekken master was the 'clean-up on aisle living room'?
      
      Yours in joystick agony,
