## Create a mini website!

The website should have client side routing using react-router 
/
/about
/gallery (or whatever fits your project)

It should have a navbar and footer that show on every page. 

Theme can be anything - create some data (array of objects) use that.

To help you think about your data, we're doing to look at dynamic routes this after noon 

EG - my page is going to be about Otters, so keep in mind the idea of having an 

/otters - route for all otters
/otters/:otter - dynamic route for details about a specific otter.
