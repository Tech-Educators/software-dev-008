# Week 2, Day 3

## Plan for today:

Morning: 

Recap/Discussion on some of the things we learned yesterday. 

Learn about CSS grid. We've learned flexbox - a one dimensional layout, so now we're going to learn about a different way to lay things out - css grid!

Workshop and Grid Garden. 

--

Introduction to forms : getting user input. 

Learning how to read information from the inputs. 

    - a few different ways to do this. 

---

Afternoon - persisting data using local storage. 

What do we mean by saying 'local?'


## Exercise - google things!

1. How do you add a new function to an object in JavaScript after you've already created the object?
```
    let myObj = {}
    myObj.name = 'sam'
    myObj.greet = function() {

    }

```
2. What is a callback function and how do you use it when a user clicks a button?

    A callback function is a function we pass to another function as an argument. 

3. What is CSS Grid and how is it different from Flexbox?

    CSS grid - two diminsional (horizontal and vertical) but flex is one dimensional (columns or rows). 

4. How do you set up areas in a CSS Grid?

    specify the amount of rows
    spcify the amout of columns
    grid-template-area - short hand for these two properties. 

5. What does the Event object do, and how is it used with form inputs?

    The event object is a build in object 

    ```js
    button.addEventListener('submit', function(event) {
        event.preventDefault()
    })
    
    ```

6. Bonus - find a youtube channel or resource online and share it in discord. 

// Some tips for googling things - 

Include the name of what you're trying to use - eg 'javascript timer', or 'css set background img' or 'semantic html tags' 

// stick to newer resources - css tricks, mdn, w3schools (sorry alex), javascript.info

// it sounds silly, but does the website look nice?

// if it's using var anywhere, disregard it. (mostly... unless)
