# Week 2, Day 3

## Plan for today:

Morning: 

Recap/Discussion on some of the things we learned yesterday. 

Learn about CSS grid. We've learned flexbox - a one dimensional layout, so now we're going to learn about a different way to lay things out - css grid!

Workshop and Grid Garden. 

--

Introduction to forms : getting user input. 

Learning how to read information from the inputs. 

    - a few different ways to do this. 

---

Afternoon - persisting data using local storage. 

What do we mean by saying 'local?'


## Exercise - google things!

1.  How do you add a new function to an object in JavaScript after you've already created the object?

2. What is a callback function and how do you use it when a user clicks a button?

3. What is CSS Grid and how is it different from Flexbox?

4. How do you set up areas in a CSS Grid?

5. What does the Event object do, and how is it used with form inputs?


// Some tips for googling things - 

Include the name of what you're trying to use - eg 'javascript timer', or 'css set background img' or 'semantic html tags' 

// stick to newer resources - css tricks, mdn, w3schools (sorry alex), javascript.info

// it sounds silly, but does the website look nice?

// if it's using var anywhere, disregard it. (mostly... unless)
