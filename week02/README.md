  - 🛠️ [Build a Meme Generator]

## Day 4: Interactive applications

- Work through brief of cookie clicker project
  - 🧪 [Build a Cookie Clicker Game]
- Analyse demo through dev tools
- Use events, functions, arrays, loops, objects, and timers

## Day 5: Make the cookie clicker web game

- Review this weeks concepts and capabilities
- Identify gaps and fill them in
- Review rubrics and build out submission project

## 🎓 Rubric

### 0 - Not Attempted or Non-Functional

  - functions
    - reusable function used in more than one place
    - passed to an event handler to perform a task
  - local storage
    - store cookie count and any other game information
    - restore cookie count on page load
  - event handler(s) - to increment cookie count on click
  - setInterval - perform cookie increment each second
